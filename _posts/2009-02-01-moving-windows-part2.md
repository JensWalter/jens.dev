A little while ago a posted an application which was able to move windows remotely. After receiving some feedback from users who actually use this application (originally only made as proof of concept) I decided to work on it a little more.

So here’s a little Explanation how to use it:

  * download the application directly from this blog
  * run the executable (.NET 1.1 is needed)
  * activate the window you want to move (use ALT+Tab or what ever you want)
  * the label should change and displays the actual position of your window
  * you can move the window via left, right, up and down-buttons

I think this should cover it. If somebody needs additional help or functionality just post it.

And as usual code and executable in the attachment.

downloads:

  * [applicationmover.exe](/assets/applicationmover.exe)
  * [windowsapplication1 visual studio project](/assets/windowsapplication11.rar)
