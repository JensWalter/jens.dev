      <description>I recently ran into the situation that I needed to install a TIBCO BusinessWorks with Administrator onto a RedHat Server. Under Windows the installer provides everything you need to run your domain as a Service. In Linux this looks different.

  curl – to send and receive the http request
  transform – a primitive tool to do streaming operations within one line</description>
