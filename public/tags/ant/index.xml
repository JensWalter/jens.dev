      <description>A short while ago I started using travis-ci as my continuous build environment. After running some tests I suspected that some files are missing from my ant created jar file. Sadly travis does not support a trivial way to upload the produced jar to a remote location. So I decided to take the console output (which they provide for every build job), to inspect what files are actually packaged in the jar file.</description>
