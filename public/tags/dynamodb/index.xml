      <description>In serverless architectures, as much as possible of the implementation should be done event-driven. One driver of this is using triggers whenever possible.
DynamoDB comes in very handy since it does support triggers through DynamoDB Streams. On the other end of a Stream usually is a Lambda function which processes the changed information asynchronously.
So I tried building that pattern and recognized, that it is not that straightforward to implement in cloudformation.</description>
