      <description>A little while ago a posted an application which was able to move windows remotely. After receiving some feedback from users who actually use this application (originally only made as proof of concept) I decided to work on it a little more.
So here’s a little Explanation how to use it:
 download the application directly from this blog run the executable (.NET 1.1 is needed) activate the window you want to move (use ALT+Tab or what ever you want) the label should change and displays the actual position of your window you can move the window via left, right, up and down-buttons  I think this should cover it.</description>

      <description>A colleague of mine has a dual-monitor windows system.
Unfortunately he has a different monitor setup for home and work (work – 2nd monitor on the left; home – 2nd monitor on the right). Now when you work with certain Java applications which save their position on their own you come to the point where an window pops up out of the viewing range.
Now you have nearly now way to move that window, because you can’t click it.</description>
