I just needed a dependency free version of a FormData Parser. Since all libraries I found were rather heavy weight I decided to start on my own implementation and share this one.

To use this one, you can just extends the class below.

```java
public class FileUpload extends FormDataHandler{
  @Override
  public void handle(HttpExchange httpExchange, List<MultiPart> parts){}
}
```
