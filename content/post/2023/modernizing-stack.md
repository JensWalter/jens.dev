This will be a series of posts about the steps we took to migrate an existing environment to the cloud.

All the steps we took here took us about 5 years to implement and I will post several articles about the major steps we took.

For now, this is a work in progress and I will update this page as each new article comes out.

### Lets define what we mean by Tibco classic stack

* [The Classic BusinessWorks stack]({{< ref "/post/2023/classic-stack" >}})
* [Reaping some benefits of containerization]({{< ref "/post/2023/reaping-some-benefits" >}})

### Lets start with containerization

* [Containerizing a BusinessWorks Stack]({{< ref "/post/2023/containerizing-businessworks" >}} "Containerizing a BusinessWorks Stack")

### Migration to Container Orchestration / Kubernetes

### Deployment in a GitOps world

### Scaling BW in a Kubernetes world
