This will be series of posts on what steps we took to migrate an existing Environment to the cloud.

All of the steps taken here took us about 5 years to implement and I will post several articles about the most important steps taken.

For now this is still a work in progress and I will update this page, whenever a new article come out.

### Lets define what we mean by Tibco classic stack

* [The Classic BusinessWorks stack]({{< ref "/post/2023/classic-stack" >}})
* [Reaping some benefits of containerization]({{< ref "/post/2023/reaping-some-benefits" >}})

### Lets start with containerization

* [Containerizing a BusinessWorks Stack]({{< ref "/post/2023/containerizing-businessworks" >}} "Containerizing a BusinessWorks Stack")

### Migration to Container Orchestration / Kubernetes

### Deployment in a GitOps world

### Scaling BW in a Kubernetes world
