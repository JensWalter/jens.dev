      <description>In my last post &amp;ldquo;the serverless API&amp;rdquo; I explained how an API could be build without any infrastructure to begin with. To prove my point I started building an API on top of an existing homepage.
Mintos is a service I use for investing into p2p loans. If you want further information about Mintos head over to their FAQ section.
overview
what data does it expose
Since the export of data from Mintos is somewhat limited, I settled for what I could get without putting too much effort in it.</description>

      <description>Building an API does come with a lot of different facets to consider. One of the greater ones is, how to run all this. Building an API implementation is a rather easy Task, most developers today have some experience with connecting with API and already had their point of contact with various technologies to fulfill this task.
A much greater pain point comes in if you start to think about, how to host this implementation and make it secure.</description>
