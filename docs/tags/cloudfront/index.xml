      <description>Here my scenario I try to cover this time.
Scenario:
host a webpage through S3 with Cloudfront as CDN host an API through ApiGateway with Cloudfront in front As picture this would look like this:
The use case would be to host the API and static resources within one domain. The obvious perk of this architecture would be no more CORS dependency.
I use a CloudFormation template as project definition for this task.</description>
