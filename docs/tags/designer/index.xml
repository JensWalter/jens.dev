      <title>TIBCO Designer Panel too small</title>

      <description>Recently I ran into some rather trivial problem which isn’t really addressed by the TIBCO Designer. I had a process which wouldn’t fit into the Design Panel. There was just not enough space on the canvas to fit in the actual flow.
After asking around I came to the conclusion that every designer (from different colleges I work with) had a different resolution for the Design canvas. Nobody knew any kind of property where you can set this resolution, so I began searching around.</description>

      <description>During Research for my last blog post I found an interesting feature of the designer. If the designer uses more than one gigabyte of heap memory, the display of the memory usage gets a bit fuzzy.
Obviously somebody at TIBCO forgot to round the value, so it would fit into this small section of the status bar.
Keeping that in mind I found a start parameter which allows you to start the designer with an external window which only displays the current memory load.</description>

      <description>I’m using the TIBCO designer for quite a while now. Before using it in a debian environment I developed all TIBCO related stuff in Windows XP. Now with the switch to linux there came quite a shift in user experience. One thing that really annoyed me was the slow performance of the designer debugger.
So I started some measurements with a simple test process. The test process creates a simple list of all files (2000 items) in one folder and then iterates over every entry.</description>
