      <description>Sometimes Java processes start accumulating memory over time and do not give them back to the OS. In previous versions of Java, this was a limitation of the JVM. In Java 8 and newer, with the arrival of the G1 garbage collector, the JVM releases memory back to the OS after a GC run.
Now since this is possible, calling a GC, although there is still free memory available becomes a different meaning.</description>

      <title>Java SPI - a simple hello world service</title>

      <description>I recently needed a simple example of an SPI implementation I could send around as copy and paste template. After some looking around I found some tutorials, but most of them were rather heavy in the implementation and are thereby loosing the point of being a simple extension system within the JDK. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a more complete introduction into SPI, just go for the oracle tutorial.
So what I wanted to build was a simple service (HelloService), which defines an interface but looks for its implementation in the classpath at runtime (something SPI was built for).</description>

      <description>I just needed a dependency free version of a FormData Parser. Since all libraries I found were rather heavy weight I decided to start on my own implementation and share this one.
To use this one, you can just extends the class below.
public class FileUpload extends FormDataHandler{ @Override public void handle(HttpExchange httpExchange, List&amp;lt;MultiPart&amp;gt; parts){} } </description>

      <description>A short while ago I started using travis-ci as my continuous build environment. After running some tests I suspected that some files are missing from my ant created jar file. Sadly travis does not support a trivial way to upload the produced jar to a remote location. So I decided to take the console output (which they provide for every build job), to inspect what files are actually packaged in the jar file.</description>

      <title>debugging a java application with an interactive shell</title>

      <description>Since a while ago, the JVM has an embedded Javascript engine within. Since Java 8 (I think) this engine got extended through an interactive shell. So now you can start an interactive Javascript shell within your JVM. Knowing that, I wondered why nobody tried to use this feature, to do some debugging. So I tried.
First I had to find the coresponding class of the jjs tool. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I found the right one, but I did find a Shell class within the nashorn.</description>

      <title>add jar to the classpath at runtime in jjs (the hacky way)</title>

      <description>Normally, the JVM does not allow extending the classpath during runtime. But due to the demand, people found ways around that restriction. To bring one of the work-around to jjs I wrote the following javascript function.
function addUrlToClasspath(pathName){ var/*java.net.URLClassLoader*/ sysloader = /*(java.net.URLClassLoader) */ java.lang.ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(); var/*java.lang.Class*/ sysclass = java.net.URLClassLoader.class; var ClassArray = Java.type(&amp;#34;java.lang.Class[]&amp;#34;); var parameters = new ClassArray(1); parameters[0]= java.net.URL.class; var/*java.lang.reflect.Method*/ method = sysclass.getDeclaredMethod(&amp;#34;addURL&amp;#34;, parameters); method.setAccessible(true); var ObjectArray = Java.type(&amp;#34;java.lang.Object[]&amp;#34;); var array = new ObjectArray(1); var/*java.</description>

      <title>doing objects in jjs</title>

      <description>Instantiating a Java Object in jjs is pretty straight forward, at least it can be.
var string = new java.lang.String(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); //alternative var stringClass = Java.type(&amp;#34;java.lang.String&amp;#34;); var string = new stringClass(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); This was so easy that I instantly continued trying Arrays.
//doing it javascript style var arr=[]; arr[0]=&amp;#34;hello&amp;#34;; arr[1]=&amp;#34;world&amp;#34;; java.lang.String.join(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;,arr); //doing it java style var stringClass=java.lang.String.class; var arr2==java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(StringClass,2); You could argue that using the java style initialization doesn&amp;rsquo;t add anything and complicates stuff overly.</description>

      <description>The task is pretty simple, read the content of text file as one-liner. Here is what I came up with.
var filename = &amp;#34;engine.log&amp;#34;; var content = new java.lang.String( java.nio.file.Files.readAllBytes( java.nio.file.Paths.get(filename) ) ); </description>

      <guid>https://jens.dev/2015/06/11/print-something-to-the-console-in-jjs.html</guid>
      <description>Once I got jjs running I started with some pretty simple stuff. To print something to the console I found the following ways.
//javascript style print(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); // don&amp;#39;t forget the parentheses here, otherwise jjs wont like you //java style var System = Java.type(&amp;#39;java.lang.System&amp;#39;); System.out.println(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); //of course there is an error out too System.err.println(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to declare System as Variable, otherwise it will fail.
nashorn&amp;gt; System.out.println(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;); script error: ReferenceError: &amp;#34;System&amp;#34; is not defined in &amp;lt;STDIN&amp;gt; at line number 1 </description>

      <description>Recently I wanted to try the new java8 integration javascipt shell. So I installed the Oracle JDK on my mac, opened a terminal and got the following result:
localhost:~ jens$ jjs -bash: jjs: command not found After some googling around I found that the jjs execution is part of the packaged jdk but not really there. After some time I found that it is installed under the name jrunscript. So now I only had to alias jjs to jrunscript and I could start.</description>

      <title>improve TIBCO Designer tester performance under linux</title>

      <description>Iâ€™m using the TIBCO designer for quite a while now. Before using it in a debian environment I developed all TIBCO related stuff in Windows XP. Now with the switch to linux there came quite a shift in user experience. One thing that really annoyed me was the slow performance of the designer debugger.
So I started some measurements with a simple test process. The test process creates a simple list of all files (2000 items) in one folder and then iterates over every entry.</description>
