      <description>Tracking dynamic sites is sometimes a bit tricky. Typically tracking systems are specialized in tracking page views. More sophisticated system have there own way of tracking custom event (like shown here).
Unfortunately I needed to track clicks on a HTML canvas. To make these clicks visible to a tracking system, I wanted to transform each click to virtual URL. That way I could use Google analytics not only for tracking but also for popularity statistics of certain content.</description>

      <description>A little time ago I started experimenting with some of the new HTML 5 features. Some seam pretty impressive although some a rather unnecessary in my opinion. But one thing got me really hooked â€“ the HTML canvas.
The possibilities of this control are only limited by the performance of javascript and the missing 3d feature (hopefully this comes pretty soon). With that technology I finally got some way to implement something I wanted to try for some time now.</description>
