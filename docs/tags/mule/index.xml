      <description>Doing some integration in Mule Anypoint Studio a stumbled upon something I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect. I wanted to have a parent flow which orchestrates several subFlows. The first subFlow was to ensure authentication and generate a security token. So I needed that token in all subsequent flows to embed it in all requests. To my surprise, this didn&amp;rsquo;t work out-of-box with mule 3.7.
Here the basic process a wanted to build. Obviously I missed something pretty basic here.</description>
