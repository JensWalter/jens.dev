      <description>The GLUEscript runtime is still in an pretty early development stage. Basically they use the Firefox spidermonkey javascript engine and build some useful libraries on top of that (like curl, mysql, filesystem support).
They also provide a little help in form of a little text file, but with this, it still took me half a day for my first installation. Most issues I got were based on version mismatches, because debian and also ubuntu use older versions of the required libraries.</description>

      <description>Recently I got a hardware upgrade so I could finally switch to a 64-bit environment. To fully use that machine I wanted to install TIBCO in 64-bit mode. After starting the installation I got this message:
 TIBINS202527: Error: ERROR: You are running a 64-bit product installer on a 32-bit system.
  This is not supported.
 The Problem was I was running a 64-bit OS with a 64-bit Kernel:</description>
