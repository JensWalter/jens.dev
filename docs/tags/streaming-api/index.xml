      <description>As I have a lot to do right am not really coming closer to my goal to write a general purpose app which can pull data from the yahoo streaming server. So I decided to post a few facts about the yahoo api. I hope this helps someone developing his app. So lets see what we have. First an explanation of these cryptic symbols:
 a00: ask price
  b00: bid price</description>

      <description>A little while ago a posted a primitive way to get to yahoo finance streaming data. As you can guess this was just the beginning. To raise the bar I tried to parse the received data and bring it to the shell. To get this done I needed several tools.
  curl – to send and receive the http request
  transform – a primitive tool to do streaming operations within one line</description>

      <description>In the past I used this ruby script to poll for the current stock data and put it into a database to create a little history.
Recently I saw a new feature on the yahoo finance homepage. Now it is possible to enable a streaming option and then you get a live update on certain values via AJAX. So I thought why not get this feature and let yahoo stream the content to the client instead of polling the server from time to time.</description>
