      <description>Integrating API Gateway with other AWS Services can be pretty important to increase the scope of an API into other services.
What I wanted to achieve was a cheaper upload mechanism for S3. The easiest way to allow upload through API gateway is to call a Lambda for every API call and then upload the payload into an S3 bucket. But this is rather costly if you increase the throughput from a few single call to a few hundred calls a second.</description>
